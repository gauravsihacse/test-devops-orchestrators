# Swap Optimizer – DevOps Candidate Challenge

Welcome! This project is a real-world simulation of a token swap optimizer using live Chainlink price feeds on Ethereum mainnet. It includes both a backend orchestrator and a lightweight API layer. Your role is to run, debug, and improve the system as a DevOps engineer.

---

## Project Overview

This app continuously:
- Connects to Ethereum via Infura
- Fetches token prices from Chainlink
- Calculates optimal token swap paths
- Logs all swap paths to `logs/swap_routes.json`
- Emits uptime and heartbeat logs to `logs/output.log`

A REST API (`api.js`) exposes:
- `/api/routes`: Latest swap paths
- `/api/routes/:from/:to`: Single pair lookup
- `/healthz`: System heartbeat check based on logs
- `/metrics`: Prometheus-style metrics (uptime, memory, CPU)

---

## Your Tasks

### 1. Setup and Launch

Run the app using the provided scripts:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh start.sh
./setup.sh
./start.sh
```

Ensure you configure `.env` from `.env_example` with your Infura Project ID.

#### Development
- Run in Dev Mode
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Build and Run
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### 2. Observe the Logs

Monitor live status:

```bash
tail -f logs/output.log
tail -f logs/swap_routes.json
```

Also visit:

- http://localhost:4000/api/routes
- http://localhost:4000/healthz
- http://localhost:4000/metrics

### 3. Debug: Silent Failure Simulation

After 30 seconds, `output.log` will stop updating — without crashing the app. Your job:

- Identify and fix the root cause of this silent failure
- Make heartbeat logs reliable again

### 4. Improve Shell Scripts

Refactor and harden:

- `setup.sh`: Validate environment, improve logging
- `start.sh`: Add safety features, background tasks, or monitoring

### 5. Containerize the Application

- Create a `Dockerfile` to run `app.js` and `api.js`
- Optional: Add `docker-compose.yml` for easier orchestration
- Ensure logs persist and `.env` can be injected cleanly

### 6. Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Triggers on push events on the main branch
- Builds a Docker image of the project
- Tags the image using the current Git commit SHA
- (Optional) Pushes the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry)

### 7. Bonus (Optional)

You may optionally:

- Build a log monitoring watchdog (bash or node)
- Add `logrotate` or timestamp-based log separation
- Serve a `/status.html` page from the API with live stats

## Functional Endpoints

| Endpoint                  | Description                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/api/routes`             | All recent swap paths                       |
| `/api/routes/:from/:to`   | One specific token pair                     |
| `/healthz`                | Uptime check (based on heartbeat log)       |
| `/metrics`                | Prometheus metrics (uptime, memory, CPU)    |

## 🔍 Evaluation Criteria

| Category        | Expectations                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Reliability** | Can you make the service stable?             |
| **Observability** | Do you improve logs, health, metrics?       |
| **Shell Scripting** | Are scripts clean, safe, readable?        |
| **Containerization** | Do you build a usable Docker setup?      |
| **Problem Solving** | Can you debug a hidden runtime issue?     |
